                <p>In the first few years only, he partnered with his 2nd cousin Champaklal Damani and then included other relatives and friends to work with them as they started exporting spices to the Eastern and Asian countries. He was always a risk-taker, starting the business with just 15000 bucks and building from scratch. In these nascent years, the business was called Reliance Commercial Corporation. Their office was tiny, and the assistants helped him a great deal in setting up the business. After a few years, in 1965 due to temperamental differences, Dhirubhai separated from Champaklal and started his own. Then he mostly dealt with the export of polyester and it was his foray into the textile industry, and under the name of the label, 'Vimal' other clothing items like sarees, dresses, shawls and suits were sold.</p>
                <p>On May 8 1973 he changed the name Reliance Commercial Corporation to Reliance Industries. And very soon, it held a name for itself even in the domestic market for its good quality products and with extensive endorsing of the same values in the Indian interiors. He also delved into synthetic textiles when the commodities of his company were at their peak. In 1966, he made his debut in backward integration and opened the Reliance Textile mill. And gradually built into the magnum petrochemical, plastic and power generation mammoth.</p>

                <p>Dhirubhai Ambani proposed for investing and finance from the National Banks, and on refusal, he made the company public in the year 1977. Dhirubhai also became the first face of Indian business who conquered the Industrial sector globally. He also rallied with the Bombay Stock Exchange when he attained a huge profit from supplying his own shares to The Bear Cartel, who were trying to overtake him. There was a roar in the market about how he could make such a profit when the crisis fell on the entire nation. And to figure out the Bombay office was also closed for 3 days to figure out the workings. And Pranab Mukherjee, the then Prime Minister also came to his defence about the stock market and Dhirubhai’s works which were legal and by any means did not engage in unethical transaction procedures.</p>
                <p>Even with many allegations of fraud and debauchery from the media and the market, the investors stood unshaken and trusted him. The investors never doubted Dhirubhai’s capability as a businessman and their shares and dividends value only grew. He was truly a maestro in the stock market and many people attended his meetings where he talked about it to gain knowledge. Reliance Industries became the first-ever privately-owned Indian Company enlisted in the illustrious list of Fortune 500 in the year 2012. He lived a fine life with his family, children, and grandchildren.</p>
